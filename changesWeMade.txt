There are the changes we made to the original FIH repo:

- The provided repo was more than 8 years old. It had serveral issues like outdated dependencies, broken packages, duplicate assets, etc. 
We took all that code and refactored it to a more user-friendly newer application.

- The provided repo had extremely CRITICAL security issues. It has the aws rds database API key, password username and everything else literally commited to main 
without any sort of .env file or placeholders. We fixed that by using an .env file for our GMAPS and GEMINI APIs.

- The original app was built with the assumption of internet availability. However, as per our interviews with Allan, we found out that 
the Galapagos Islands are a place with extremely limited availability. So we modified the app to not use AWS to store assets but instead store them locally
though we did provide some features like AI chatbot for when the user does have an internet connection.

- We updated the design to be more appealing to the user. Added some young features that young people would like such as maps, things to do, conservation efforts etc.

- We added more documentation.

- We decided on clear future steps from our work that can be taken to make the application even better.
